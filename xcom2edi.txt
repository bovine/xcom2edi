                           by JL Enterprises, 1996


***********************
***  Opening Words  ***
***********************
If you're just dying to get started using this editor, then go ahead--you
can read this file later.  However, you should completely read through this
file if you later have any questions.  Specifically, the "Comments/Common
Problems" section contains information about non-intuitive problems you
might find.


**********************
***  Introduction  ***
**********************
XCOMII is an ingenious game by Microprose that does not take much time at all
to master.  The game itself, however, sometimes becomes difficult because you
must manage your resources carefully.  This simple little program allows you
to edit various items stored in the saved game files created by UFO, such as
your total money, the various items in your storehouses, the types of
buildings you have on your different bases, and also the statistics of any
soldier that you have recruited.



********************************
***  Description of Options  ***
********************************
MONEY EDITOR -- The money editing option is fairly simple and merely gives
you whatever dollar amount you enter.  Note that it is not really recommended
that you enter a value that is too significantly higher than the "lots"
button as when you get paid again in the game, your dollar amount will
wrap around to 0.  If this happens, you can always use the editor again.

INVENTORY EDITOR -- The inventory option allows you to modify the amount
of any particular item you have in the storehouses at any particular base.
Be warned that the editor allows you to modify your game so that you have
more items than you have space for.  The only problem with this is that if
you move an item from your stores into a ship, you will not be able to move
it back unless you use the editor and decrease the amount of items you have
so that the total space used can be stored within your storehouses.

BUILDING EDITOR -- One might ask why you'd need to create buildings when you
can do that in the game.  Well, for one thing, it won't require any money to
create buildings inside my editor.  When you create a building, you are
prompted for the number of days until its constuction is complete.  Usually
there is no reason why "0" (immediate construction) cannot be used, however
at least a couple of the structures require the game to actually "see" the
completion of the building for it to become functional, and so it may be
necessary for "1" day of construction be specified.  The "Details" button
allows you to modify some of the costs and values that the game uses during
play, including its construction cost, regular maintenance costs, normal
construction time (if built completely within the game), the building's
defense value, and the chances of the building getting hit by aliens.  Note
that these building details relate to ALL buildings of that TYPE in that
saved game.

SOLDIER EDITOR -- The soldier editor option is especially useful because
you can greatly improve the accuracy of your soldiers and can even put any
type of armour available in the game on your men.  You can promote your
soldiers to any rank, reanimate dead soldiers, and even do immediate (and
free) transfers to your other bases.  Version 1.1 of the editor introduced
the ability to edit the names of your characters to whatever you like.
Version 1.2 added the ability to do an mass editing of many soldiers at
once.  When you choose this option, any changes that you make at the next
screen will be applied to all soldiers at all of the checked bases.  Version
1.5 reimplemented the code to allow transferring of soldiers between bases.

SOLDIER IMPORT -- A soldier import function allows you to bring your
characters from an old XCOM I game into any XCOM II game.  This feature was
added in version 1.1 of the editor and allows players with well-seasoned
characters to continue right where they left off!  Unfortunately, since I
cannot identify all aspects of the saved game file, not everything converts
correctly.  For instance, the image which represents your character during
battle will most likely be incorrect.  Most of the stats, however, should
be brought over okay, though.

OBJECT EDITOR -- Another function of this editor is to allow you to edit
the strengths and aspects of the weapons and ammo used in the game itself.
With this option, you can modify any weapon so that it does not require any
ammo at all, takes no time to shoot it, has greater than 100% accuracy, and
is extremely explosive, or whatever you like.  Be warned that these changes
do not apply specifically to any saved game, but to the entire game itself,
which is why the option for this editor appears on the main editor screen.
Also, be warned that the changes you make to weapons will also affect the
weapons of the aliens.  This can be both good and bad, so be aware of which
weapons you and the aliens can possess.

BACKUP/RESTORE -- One of the nicest features of this editor is that as of
version 1.2, it now has options to make an emergency backup a your saved
game by running PKZIP (that already must be in your DOS path statement).
This allows you to easily revert back to a previous copy of the game should
you make significant changes that negatively affect your saved game.
Remember, this editor is not warranted to always be able to perform as
expected.  I have tried to throughly test it on my system with my version
of the game, yet it may not work with other releases that Microprose may
release.  I seriously recommend that you make a backup of each game you
modify when you first use this editor.

INCREASED KNOWLEDGE -- Version 1.3 also adds a button which will increase
your knowledge in the game by giving you credit for researching all items
that you can in the game, giving you access to all entries in the game's
Ufopedia, and the ability of your engineers to produce all items the game
normally allows.  Due to the complexity of the research trees, there is no
capability in the editor to allow selective advances in knowledge, nor are
there any plans to allow this.

TACTICAL EDITOR -- The tactical editor can be easily argued to be one of the
most powerful features of this entire editor.  It allows you to modify the
health, energy, time units, and several other fields for all of the soldiers
and aliens while you have landed at a site.  Version 1.5 of the editor
greatly enhanced this editor by allowing you to affect the max values of
each of the stats, as well as adding the ability to edit many other stats.
This function can also be used to resurrect killed players by simply raising
their health.  By editing the shok value to a lower value, you can revive
an unconscious character.  You can also modify the armour and fatal wounds
of a character to reduce a player's chances of dying.

ALIEN CONTAINMENT EDITOR -- This editor was added in version 1.5 and allows
you to modify the types of aliens that you have in your alien containment
units at each of your bases (note that the editor allows you to have aliens
in storage even though you may not have any in the game).  The editor also
allows you to have captured alien type/rank combinations that are impossible
to actually have in the game.  You should try to avoid doing this because
the game does not have any database information on these aliens and
researching them will not yield anything.

SUBMARINE EDITOR -- Version 1.5 of the editor added the capability of
modifying the weapons, fuel, and stores that you have on your submarines.
As with the inventory editor, the editor does no intentional checking of
whether you can actually store as many things as you specify.


**********************
***  Installation  ***
**********************
This editor was originally written with the use of a VGA monitor in mind,
however, I've taken care to write my routines so that they should run on
even a monochrome monitor (although the lowest monitor that I was able to
test this program on was a CGA).  You will also require at least enought
space on your hard drive to place the exe file of the editor in your main
XCOM2 directory.  Also, a mouse is absolutely required to use the editor
at all and there does not seem to be any change in this requirement in
any future versions.


**********************************
***  Comments/Common Problems  ***
**********************************
ADVANCED EDITING -- The object editor and tactical editors both have an
advanced editing button as of version 1.5 of the editor.  This button allows
you to modify/view some of the fields that have not been fully tested or
verified.  If you want to experiment with these values, feel free, but be
cautioned that your changes may actually corrupt your game and cause XCOM2
to crash if you enter certain values.  If you notice a correlation in any
of the unknown fields or find something that is labelled incorrectly, then
please notify me!  It will help me add additional functionality to future
versions of the editor.

BUILDING EDITOR -- Some of the buildings in the game require completion of
construction to actually be "seen" by the game.  This means that if you
create buildings with "0" construction time, the building may not actually
have any effect in the game.  Therefore, if you notice that your defences
aren't working, try recreating them in the editor with "1" day of building
time and TFTD should see it and make it active 24 game-hours later.

BUILDING EDITOR -- The Details button in the Buildings Editor affects ALL
buildings of that TYPE in that saved game, NOT just for a particular base
or a structure in a base.  Note also that the "Increased Knowledge" button
will reset any changes you've made in the "Building Details" editor.

OBJECT EDITOR -- Keep in mind that the object editor modifies the OBDATA.DAT
file which is stored in the GEODATA directory where your XCOM game is
located.  This means that if you're playing the CD version of the game, you
will not be able to use these two portions of the editor.  I have been
informed by a user that you can install the game completely on your hard
drive and then run the editor from that directory without any problems.  To
do this, run the INSTALL file on the CD under the directory HARDDISK.  It
only takes 20 MB of hard disk space.

OBJECT EDITOR -- Values for some of the weapons in the object editor are
actually hard coded into the XCOM2 executables and thus cannot be changed
very easily.  Therefore you may notice that the game will ignore the changes
you make to some of the weapons.  If you discover this, your only choice is
to try your changes on another weapon and use that weapon in the game.

OBJECT EDITOR -- I've been told that the object editor seems to work with the
original XCOM, although I haven't tried it myself.  Most of the other parts of
the editor probably aren't as compatible with the original, though.  I've you
are looking for a good XCOM/UFO editor, I actually did write one, which later
evolved into XCOM2EDI.  This original version can still be found on my FTP
site and on my web page.

TACTICAL EDITOR -- Many of the stats in the tactical editor should not be
taken above 180 (the game's actual maximum) or else some of your other stats
will begin to decrease very rapidly.

TACTICAL EDITOR -- If any of your soldiers die while in battle, you can
resurrect them in the tactical editor by raising their health.  Unfortunately,
the game is still able to remember the fact that your soldier died.  This
means that when you complete the battle, the game will remove that soldier
from your roster even if he/she is still alive.  The only way that I know to
get around this is to go select that soldier in the tactical editor, hit
the advanced button, and change the unitnum value to 255 (you can hit the max
button to do this).  This essentially "dissociates" the soldier and prevents
the game from removing it from your roster.  All record of that soldier going
on that mission will not be saved (ie: # of kills, # of missions, etc).

TACTICAL EDITOR -- Do not edit the strength of your soldiers so that it is
over 50.  Doing so will cause your soldiers to be unable to throw projectile
items such as grenades.



**********************
***  Revision Log  ***
**********************
1.0 - initial release
1.1 - added soldier import function and the weapon and ammo editors.
      fixed a bug in the soldier editor that would unintentionally move
      many of your soldiers to other bases.  added ability to edit the
      names of your soldiers.
1.2 - fixed a bug in the bravery editing of the soldier editor.  added
      pkzip/pkunzip buttons to make and restore backups of your saved
      games.  a couple of other internal memory allocation problems fixed.
      (this was not a widely distributed version)
1.3 - made many of the error messages more informative.  revised documention
      significantly.  made the registration procedure more tolerant of
      upper/lower case letters and symbols in your name and phone numbers.
      added button to increase your knowledge, edit multiple soldiers in
      the soldier editor, and shortcut to quickly finish any building with
      the right mouse button.
1.4 - very minor changes in this version.  the maximum button has been
      replaced with a lots button, which defaults to 180 when editing
      soldier attributes.  the mouse routines have been modified slightly
      so that if Windows is detected, the graphical mouse cursor is disabled
      and will instead use the mouse cursor generated by the mouse driver,
      which eliminates problems encountered when running the editor in a
      windowed DOS box.  the tactical editor now puts checkmarks next to
      enemy units so that they may be distinguished more easily.
1.5 - Many new changes.  The weapon and ammo editors have been combined and
      additional functionality added to create a new object editor.  The
      soldier editor can now transfer soldiers again (this function was
      disabled because it wasn't working reliably).  Several of the editors
      have been revised to eliminate the need to click an 'edit' button after
      selecting the item or value to change.  The tactical editor has been
      greatly improved by adding ability to edit additional fields, making
      its changes affect more than one turn.  A new alien containment editor
      has been added to allow you to add/delete aliens in your containment
      buildings.  Documentation cleaned up significantly.  Editor will now
      look in the directory it is located in (not the current) for its
      registration file.  Building editor now allows creation of buildings
      with specific construction times.  A "Details" button added to Building
      Editor to allow modification of construction costs, etc.



**********************
***  Distribution  ***
**********************
First of all, this program is distributed only through Shareware means, which
means that it depends upon others to upload it to any appropriate on-line
service that maintains collections of similar programs.  You are encouraged
to do this, however this editor must be distributed without any modifications
to the program itself and with all of files that you originally received with
it.  Furthermore, any disassembling, modification, reverse-engineering,
distribution of registration key files, serial numbers, or programs that
attempt to defeat the registration of this program, or any other activities
that might possibly deny the author of this saved game editor of any
registration fees is forbidden and strongly discouraged.

Second, the usage of this program is not free.  I require that if you use
this program more than once, you should register.  Registration only costs
US $5 and will remove the 'enter the number' prompt upon startup and will
also display that the program is registered to you--to give you something
to be proud of.  Additionally, as of version 1.3, all new functions will
not be available until your register.

Third, if you find a version of this editor that appears to be tampered with
(virus infection, missing/corrupted documentation, etc), it is recommended
that you try to obtain a version directly from me (see the bottom of this
file for details).  You should additionally try to contact the maintainer
of the archive where you obtained it from (or contact me and I'll try to).



**********************
***  Registration  ***
**********************
To register, simply send US $5 (preferably a personal check) along with
your name, and telephone number.  Note that those three things are required.
The phone number is especially important because it is used in generating
the serial number.  Please do not forget to include it!

Additionally, if you have an e-mail address, please include it, otherwise
you must include a self-addressed stamped envelope.

Please make sure that all personal checks are made to JEFF LAWSON.  Any
checks made to JL Enterprises CANNOT be accepted.  Although you can send cash
to me and I will accept it, I do not recommend it because of the risk of it
getting intercepted by any of the many hands that mail must pass through.
